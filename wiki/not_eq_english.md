# C++ `not_eq`: Understanding the Not Equal Operator in C++

## Synopsis
The `not_eq` operator in C++ is a functional notation that serves as an alternative to the traditional `!=` operator, providing a way to compare two values for inequality in a more readable format.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`not_eq` is part of the C++ Standard Library and is included in the `<functional>` header. It is primarily used to provide a more human-readable way of expressing inequality, especially in contexts where the readability of logical expressions is crucial.

### Usage
To use `not_eq`, include the `<functional>` header in your program. The operator takes two arguments and returns a boolean value: `true` if the two arguments are not equal, and `false` otherwise. 

### Syntax
```cpp
#include <functional>

bool result = std::not_eq(value1, value2);
```

### Parameters
- `value1`: The first value to compare.
- `value2`: The second value to compare.

### Return Value
- Returns `true` if `value1` is not equal to `value2`.
- Returns `false` if `value1` is equal to `value2`.

## Examples
### Basic Example 1: Using `not_eq` with Integers
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;

    if (std::not_eq(a, b)) {
        std::cout << "a and b are not equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "a and b are equal." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Basic Example 2: Using `not_eq` with Strings
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::string str1 = "Hello";
    std::string str2 = "World";

    if (std::not_eq(str1, str2)) {
        std::cout << "str1 and str2 are not equal." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "str1 and str2 are equal." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
While `not_eq` can improve code readability, it is essential to note that it may not be as widely recognized as the conventional `!=` operator. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:

1. **Confusion with Logical Operators**: `not_eq` is purely for inequality checks and should not be confused with logical operators. Ensure that it is used in the right logical context.
   
2. **Usage in Templates**: When used with template types, ensure that the types you are comparing support the inequality operation. If not, it may lead to compile-time errors.

3. **Readability vs. Familiarity**: While `not_eq` can enhance readability, some programmers may prefer the familiar `!=` operator. Itâ€™s important to maintain consistency in your codebase.

## One Line Summary
`not_eq` is a C++ operator that provides a clear and readable way to check for inequality between two values.
