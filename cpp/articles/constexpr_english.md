# Understanding `constexpr` in C++: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
`constexpr` is a keyword in C++ that allows the evaluation of expressions at compile time, enabling the creation of fast and efficient code by defining constant expressions and functions that the compiler can evaluate during compilation.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `constexpr` keyword was introduced in C++11 and has been enhanced in later versions (C++14, C++17, and C++20) to allow for more flexible compile-time computations. It is primarily used for:

- Defining constant values that can be evaluated at compile time.
- Creating functions that can also be evaluated at compile time, provided their inputs are constant expressions.

### Usage
To define a variable or a function with `constexpr`, simply precede its declaration with the keyword. For variables, this guarantees that the variable is immutable and initialized at compile time. For functions, it allows the function body to be evaluated at compile time if called with constant arguments.

#### Syntax for Variables
```cpp
constexpr type variable_name = value;
```

#### Syntax for Functions
```cpp
constexpr return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // function body
}
```

### Details
- **Compile-time Evaluation**: The primary advantage of `constexpr` is its ability to enable compile-time evaluation. This can lead to performance improvements, as computations are done during compilation rather than at runtime.
- **Implicitly `const`**: When a variable is declared as `constexpr`, it is implicitly treated as `const`, meaning it cannot be modified after its initial assignment.
- **C++ Standards Evolution**: In C++14, the capabilities of `constexpr` functions were expanded to allow more complex operations, including conditionals and loops. C++17 further enhanced `constexpr` by allowing dynamic memory allocation and virtual calls within `constexpr` functions.

## Examples
### Basic Usage of `constexpr` Variables
```cpp
constexpr int max_size = 100; // Compile-time constant
```

### Basic Usage of `constexpr` Functions
```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x; // Evaluates at compile time if x is a constant expression
}

int main() {
    constexpr int result = square(5); // result is 25, evaluated at compile time
}
```

### Using `constexpr` in a Class
```cpp
class Circle {
public:
    constexpr Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    constexpr double area() const { return 3.14159 * square(radius); }

private:
    double radius;
};

int main() {
    constexpr Circle c(5);
    constexpr double c_area = c.area(); // Compile-time evaluation of area
}
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Non-constant Arguments**: If a `constexpr` function is called with non-constant arguments, it will not be evaluated at compile time, which can lead to confusion regarding performance.
- **Complexity Restrictions**: In C++11 and C++14, `constexpr` functions were limited to single return statements. This restriction was eased in C++14 and later, but developers should still ensure their functions adhere to compile-time evaluation rules.
- **Implicit `const`**: Users should be aware that `constexpr` variables cannot be modified after initialization, and attempting to do so will result in a compilation error.

### Additional Notes
- Not all expressions can be evaluated as `constexpr`. For example, calling non-`constexpr` functions or using certain runtime features within `constexpr` functions is prohibited.
- The C++ standard library also provides many `constexpr` functions, which can be used to perform compile-time computations with standard types.

## One Line Summary
`constexpr` in C++ allows for the definition of compile-time constant variables and functions, enhancing performance by enabling compile-time evaluation of expressions.
