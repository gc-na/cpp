# Understanding the `export` Keyword in C++

## Synopsis
The `export` keyword in C++ is used to facilitate the separation of the interface and implementation of template classes and functions, enabling their definitions to be separated across multiple translation units.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `export` keyword was introduced in C++ to allow template definitions to be split across different files, enhancing code organization and compilation efficiency. However, it is important to note that the `export` keyword was never widely adopted and is no longer part of the C++ standard as of C++11.

### Usage
When the `export` keyword is applied to a template definition, it allows that template to be defined in one translation unit while being instantiated in another. This feature aimed to reduce compilation dependencies but was not implemented by many compilers, leading to its deprecation.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
export template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
    void myFunction();
};

// Definition can be in a different file
export template <typename T>
void MyClass<T>::myFunction() {
    // function implementation
}
```

### Details
- The use of `export` is often accompanied by a template declaration followed by the actual template definition.
- Due to its lack of support in popular compilers like GCC and MSVC, using `export` is generally discouraged, and developers are encouraged to keep both declarations and definitions in header files instead.
- Since C++11, the language has evolved with improved features like inline namespaces and `constexpr`, which serve as modern alternatives to address template usage without the need for `export`.

## Examples
### Example 1: Basic Template Definition with `export`
```cpp
// my_template.h
export template <typename T>
class MyTemplate {
public:
    void display();
};

// my_template.cpp
export template <typename T>
void MyTemplate<T>::display() {
    std::cout << "Template Display Function" << std::endl;
}
```

### Example 2: Using `export` with Functions
```cpp
// my_functions.h
export template <typename T>
void myFunction(T value);

// my_functions.cpp
export template <typename T>
void myFunction(T value) {
    std::cout << "Value: " << value << std::endl;
}
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Compiler Support**: Most major compilers, including GCC and MSVC, do not support the `export` keyword. Attempting to use it may lead to compilation errors.
2. **Code Maintenance**: Relying on `export` can lead to confusion about where template definitions are located, making code harder to maintain.
3. **Obsolescence**: Since `export` has been removed from the C++ standard in C++11, using it may lead to compatibility issues with modern C++ standards and practices.

### Additional Notes
For most use cases, it is recommended to define templates entirely in header files. This approach ensures that all necessary code is included during compilation, preventing issues related to missing definitions across translation units.

## One Line Summary
The `export` keyword in C++ allows template definitions to be separated from their declarations across translation units, but it is deprecated and not widely supported in modern C++ development.
